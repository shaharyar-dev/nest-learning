Install Nest JS Globally by npm
npm i -g @nestjs/cli

Install Nest JS Globally by pnpm
pnpm add -g @nestjs/cli

Create New project 
nest new nestjs-fresh-learning and choose pnpm

For default
pnpm run

For dev
pnpm run start:dev (run time changes)


For run test
pnpm run test

For end to end test
pnpm run test:e2e

For Build
pnpm run build

For port already in use
sudo lsof -i :3000
Kill -9 id

To install fastify
pnpm i @nestjs/platform-fastify -d

To use fastify or any other platform
1) go to main.ts file and add second parameter
import { FastifyAdapter } from '@nestjs/platform-fastify';
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule,new FastifyAdapter());

For fastify to add domain specific ip
await app.listen(3000,"0.0.0.0");

Body() will work with json and url-encode

To use depency injection we have to register in ioc container as provider

IOC Approach
We are delegating control to Nestjs runtime for instantiation & managing dependencies.

Providers Types
1) Standard / Class based
Use case Services

2) Non class based
number,boolean, string, object, Array function
Use case Configs, Database name, url, Api

3) Factory
factory function, 
Async Factory function
Use case : dynamic or conditional values, class instance

Injection Types
Dependency that we need, we can ask with an injection token either in constructor or in Property definiation

1) Constructor Injection
2) Property Injection
   a) Class provider
   b) non class 

If node module is missing
pnpm install

Injection Scope
Default Scope
Only one scope will be initialized per module

Request Scope
Scope will be initialize on every request and on response it will destroy

Transient Scope
New dedicated Instance of provider for each consumer (whoever injects it)
For example if we require different store for individual module then we will use it
user store
employer store etc

Services are used to connect with db

What is an DTO
A data transfer object (DTO) is an object that carries data between processes. You can use this technique to facilitate communication between two systems (like an API and your server) without potentially exposing sensitive information.

Modules
1) Featured Module
usersfm folder
2) Shared Module
When we use import module it is called shared module
3) Global Module
If we want to use module without mentioning it and can be call anywhere
If we mention @Global() on our module
But it should mentioned in app module default file
4) Dynamic Module
if you want to configure dynamic configuration so that where we will use dynamic module

* We can also import sub module both export and import are required so you have to mentioned it on both
